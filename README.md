## 1 - Motivation

To take a look at the data available about Covid in Brazil and to get an idea of
 what is monitored and what could be answered using the data.
Whit this in mind we could easily find the OpendataSUS, a website with a constantly
change database of monitoring accute respiratory syndrome (Sindrome Respiratoria
Aguda Grave - SRAG in portuguese) and after some cleaning identify some questions
to try to find answers.

This is a project in development for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.
The results are in the blog post:
